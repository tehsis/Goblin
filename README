"The Goblin search engine"

Author: Pablo Terradillos <tehsis@gmail.com>

The main goal of this project is to aim as an experience
in my own path to learning Perl.

It's basically a web search engine (not yet concluded) that
takes a website,extracts his arguments and stores them in a 
NoSQL Database (actually, MongoDB).
Searching is performed through website's tags and descriptions.
